## User stories

- As a hobbyist aquarium owner, I would like to be able to remotely check the status of my aquarium.
- As a user, I would like to be able to see this info on a web page or cellular application so I can be confident my aquarium is okay even when I’m not home.
- As a user, I would like to  know what the current or recent water temperature is so I can monitor if their might be an issue or failure.
- As a user, I would like to be able to see historical temperature data so I can see if my heater is wearing out or how stable my tank temperature is.

## Stretch

- As a user I would like to see historical temperature for different time intervals: day, week, month
- As a user I would like to see historical temperature displayed in a graph so I can quickly visualize the info and recognize trend and outliers
- As a user, I would like to have an automatic aquarium feeder so my fish can be feed when I am not home
- As a user I would like to know if my automatic feeding feature is activated and turn it on and off so it only feeds the fish when I’m not home .
- As a user, I would like to be able to monitor water flow so I can make sure the pumps are running and could use this as indicator for leaks or pumps needing to be cleaned.

## Instillation Steps

- Run npm install to install any project dependencies 

## Some Wanted/Needed Additions 
- Better formatting for the temperature graph axis 
- Calendar Widget for date range selector
- Refactoring date format to follow MM/DD/YYYY instead of DD-MM-YYY
- And much more!
